About:-
This is an IMDB project of Web Development.
In this project, I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Features:-

1. Home Page:-

a. Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).

b. Each search result of the movie should have a favourite button, clicking on which the movie should be added to “My favourite movies” (a list).

c. On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)


2. Movie Page:-

a. Should show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).


3. My favourite movies Page:-

a. Display a list of all the favourite movies.

b. Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).

c. Remove from favourites button: Each movie should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that movie from the list.
